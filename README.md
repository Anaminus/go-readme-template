# $PROJECT

`$PROJECT` is $SUMMARY

## Installation

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Using a shell with Git (such as Git Bash), run the following command:

```
go get -u github.com/anaminus/$PROJECT
```

If you configured Go correctly, this will install $PROJECT to `$GOPATH/bin`,
which will allow you run it directly from a shell.
